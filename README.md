# LLM_Project
Financial News Sentiment Pipeline using FinBERT &amp; GPT-4

This project builds a modular NLP pipeline to extract sentiment signals from financial news articles.  
It combines traditional NLP (triplet extraction, clustering) with modern LLMs (FinBERT, GPT-4) to generate structured company-level sentiment insights.

---

##  Features
- News data collection from multiple financial sources
- Preprocessing and NLP enrichment (NER, sentiment, triplets)
- Clustering with embeddings (UMAP + HDBSCAN)
- Sentiment generation with **FinBERT**
- Sentiment generation with **GPT-4**
- JSON outputs with company tickers, sentiment, and justifications

##  Installation (Windows fresh setup)

1. **Install Python 3.10+**  
   [Download from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Open PowerShell and create a virtual environment**  
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\YourName\Documents\LLM_Project"
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   
If you get a PowerShell policy error:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

---

3. Install dependencies
```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -m textblob.download_corpora

## OpenAI API Key (for GPT step)
To use GPT-4 you need an OpenAI API key:

Get your key from OpenAI website : https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview

Add credits to your account (the GPT API is paid)

Set your key in PowerShell before running the pipeline:
 ```powershell
   setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"

## Running the Pipeline

To run the full pipeline from start to finish:

```powershell
   python run_pipeline.py
